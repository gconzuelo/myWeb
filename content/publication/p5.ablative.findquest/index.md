abstract: Barriers to access for cervical precancer care in low-resource settings go beyond cost. Gas-based cryotherapy has emerged as the standard treatment in these areas, but there are barriers to this technology that have necessitated the development and implementation of affordable and portable alternatives. This review identifies knowledge gaps with regard to technologies primarily used in low-resource settings, including standard cryotherapy, nongas-based cryotherapy, and thermoablation. These gaps are addressed using evidence-based guidelines, patient and provider acceptability, long-term obstetric outcomes, and treatment of women with HIV infection. This review highlights the need for prospective studies that compare ablative methods, especially given the increasing use of thermoablation.
