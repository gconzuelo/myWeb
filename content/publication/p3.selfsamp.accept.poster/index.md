abstract: Purpose
In high-income countries, human papillomavirus (HPV) self-sampling has been demonstrated to increase adherence to cervical cancer prevention initiatives in underscreened women. El Salvador recently completed the Cervical Cancer Prevention in El Salvador (CAPE) program using a high-risk HPV test as the screening method. Although successful, 12% of targeted women did not attend their screening appointments. HPV self-sampling may offer the opportunity to reach these nonattending women. In the current study, we evaluated HPV self-sampling as a way to increase screening among CAPE nonattenders and to report factors that impact self-sampling acceptability in a low- to middle-income country.

Methods
Nonattending and underscreened women age 30 to 59 years from the Paracentral region of El Salvador were invited to participate (N = 2,019). Women were visited at home and offered self-sampling with an HPV test. Women who provided consent also received a series of questionnaires to collect demographic and test acceptability data. After tests were analyzed, women were provided with results during another home visit. HPV-positive women were asked to make an appointment at a local clinic to undergo colposcopy, biopsy, and, if eligible, cryotherapy treatment. Women with contraindications for cryotherapy were referred to appropriate treatment or follow-up.

Results
Of 1,989 eligible women, 94% accepted the HPV self-sampled test. Of these, 11.8% (n = 221) tested positive. All but 13 women attended the colposcopy appointment, and 190 women received cryotherapy. Biopsy results revealed low-grade precancer in 6.3% of women, whereas 12.6% received diagnoses of high-grade precancer. Reasons for not attending the original CAPE appointment included logistic concerns, but also discomfort with male providers, confidentiality fears, and misconceptions regarding HPV, cervical cancer, and the screening procedure.

Conclusion
HPV self-sampling was shown to be overwhelmingly acceptable to nonattending and underscreened rural women in El Salvador. This method may be a feasible alternative that circumvents barriers to cervical cancer screening in low- to middle-income countries.
